# new-programming-language
Hello everyone. I am a very noob coder . The other day i was completing my basic course on python. I have an idea of creating my own programming language through python fumctions. The basic thing that i have done is created an add() function and called the function later. So basically the output prompts like "This is a new programming language".If the user enters 'add()' it will ask 2 numbers and after insertion of 2 nos the sum of the nos will get printed. Basically idea is using morem functions and asking the user to add certain syntaxes to do perform sum activities. We can also add our own code that will be entered by the user and the cmd ouput prompt will perform what the user wants. If anyone out there is willing to help. Please contact me.
