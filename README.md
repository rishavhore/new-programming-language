# new-programming-language
Hello everybody. I am a very noob coder , the other day i was completing my basic course on python. I had an idea of creating my own programming language through python fumctions. The basic thing that i have done is created an add() function and called the function later. So basically in the output screen the prompt shows "This is a new programming language" then if the user enters 'add()' it will ask 2 numbers and after inputting the nos the sum of the nos wipll show up. Basically idea is using morem functions and asking the user to add certain syntaxes to do perform sum activities. We can also add our own code that will be entered by the user and the cmd ouput prompt will perform what the user wants. If anyone out there is willing to help. Please contact me.
